# 3977. Minimum Time to Reach Target With Limited Power

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-reach-target-with-limited-power/)

---

You are given a **directed** weighted graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.

The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, t_i]` indicates a directed edge from node `u_i` to node `v_i` that takes `t_i` seconds to traverse.

You are also given an integer `power` representing the initial available power, and an integer array `cost` of length `n`, where `cost[u]` represents the power required to forward the signal from node `u` through **any** one of its outgoing edges.

You are given two integers `source` and `target`.

The signal starts at `source` at time 0 with `power` units of power and follows these rules:

- The signal may traverse a directed edge from node `u` only if the remaining power is **at least** `cost[u]`.
- No power is consumed when the signal arrives at a node, unless it later leaves that node by traversing another edge.
- When the signal is forwarded from node `u`, the remaining power is **decreased** by `cost[u]` units.
- Traversing an edge `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, t_i]` **increases** the total time by `t_i` seconds.

Return an integer array `answer` of size 2, where:

- `answer[0]` is the **minimum** time required for the signal to reach node `target`.
- `answer[1]` is the **maximum** remaining power among all paths that achieve `answer[0]`.

If the signal cannot reach `target`, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,4,1],[0,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], power = 4, cost = [2,3,1,1,1], source = 0, target = 4

**Output:** [3,0]

**Explanation:**

- The signal starts at node 0 with 4 units of power.
- The path `0 -> 1 -> 4` is not valid, because after leaving node 0, the signal has 2 units of power remaining, which is less than `cost[1] = 3`.
- The valid path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` takes a total time of 3.
- The total power consumed along this path is `cost[0] + cost[2] + cost[3] = 4`, leaving 0 remaining power.
- Hence, the answer is `[3, 0]`.

**Example 2:**

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/02/09/g22.png)

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,0,2]], power = 3, cost = [1,1,1], source = 1, target = 1

**Output:** [0,3]

**Explanation:**

- Since the `source` and `target` are the same node, no traversal is required.
- Hence, the minimum total time taken is 0, and no power is consumed.
- Therefore, the answer is `[0, 3]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[2,3,4]], power = 3, cost = [1,1,1,1], source = 0, target = 3

**Output:** [-1,-1]

**Explanation:**

There is no valid path from `source` to `target`, therefore return `[-1, -1]`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 1000`
- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, t_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
- `1 <= t_i <= 10^9`
- `1 <= power <= 1000`
- `cost.length == n`
- `1 <= cost[i] <= 2000`
- `0 <= source, target <= n - 1`
