# 4023. Elevator Requests II

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/elevator-requests-ii/)

---

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer `start`, representing the floor where the elevator begins, and an integer array `requests`, where `requests[i]` is a floor that the elevator is requested to reach. All floors in `requests` are **distinct**.

At time 0, the elevator is on floor `start`, and all requests are made **simultaneously**.

During each second before all requests are fulfilled, the elevator moves **exactly** one floor, either **up** or **down**. A request is fulfilled **instantly** when the elevator reaches its requested floor. If `start` appears in `requests`, that request is fulfilled at time 0.

For each second that a request remains unfulfilled, you receive 1 penalty. Equivalently, a request fulfilled at time `t` contributes `t` to the total penalty.

Return the **minimum** total penalty required to fulfill all requests.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, start = 4, requests = [1,5]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

- Move from floor 4 (`start`) to floor 5 in 1 second. Penalty for floor 5 is 1.
- Move from floor 5 to floor 1 in 4 seconds. Penalty for floor 1 is 5.

Thus, the total penalty is `1 + 5 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8, start = 3, requests = [3,7,1]

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

- Floor 3 (`start`) is fulfilled instantly. Penalty for floor 3 is 0.
- Move from floor 3 to floor 1 in 2 seconds. Penalty for floor 1 is 2.
- Move from floor 1 to floor 7 in 6 seconds. Penalty for floor 7 is 8.

Thus, the total penalty is `0 + 2 + 8 = 10`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10, start = 5, requests = [0,2,9]

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**

- Move from floor 5 (`start`) to floor 2 in 3 seconds. Penalty for floor 2 is 3.
- Move from floor 2 to floor 0 in 2 seconds. Penalty for floor 0 is 5.
- Move from floor 0 to floor 9 in 9 seconds. Penalty for floor 9 is 14.

Thus, the total penalty is `3 + 5 + 14 = 22`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 1500`
- `0 <= start, requests[i] <= n - 1`
- All values in `requests` are **distinct**.
