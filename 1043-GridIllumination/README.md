# 1001. Grid Illumination

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination/)

---

There is a 2D `grid` of size `n x n` where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially **turned off**.

You are given a 2D array of lamp positions `lamps`, where `lamps[i] = [row_i, col_i]` indicates that the lamp at `grid[row_i][col_i]` is **turned on**. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.

When a lamp is turned on, it **illuminates its cell** and **all other cells** in the same **row, column, or diagonal**.

You are also given another 2D array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [row_j, col_j]`. For the `j^th` query, determine whether `grid[row_j][col_j]` is illuminated or not. After answering the `j^th` query, **turn off** the lamp at `grid[row_j][col_j]` and its **8 adjacent lamps** if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[row_j][col_j]`.

Return *an array of integers* `ans`*,* *where* `ans[j]` *should be* `1` *if the cell in the* `j^th` *query was illuminated, or* `0` *if the lamp was not.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].
The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [1,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[0,4]], queries = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,4]]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
- `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
- `lamps[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= row_i, col_i < n`
- `queries[j].length == 2`
- `0 <= row_j, col_j < n`
