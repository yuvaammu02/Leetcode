# 4021. Minimum Operations to Make a Rotated Palindrome I

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-rotated-palindrome-i/)

---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operations any number of times (including zero) and in any order:

- **Increment**: Choose any index `i` and replace `s[i]` with the next lowercase English letter. The letter after `'z'` is `'a'`.
- **Left rotate**: Move the first character of the string to the end.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `s` a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One optimal solution:

- Left rotate the string: `"abc" -> "bca"`.
- Increment `'a'` to `'b'`: `"bca" -> "bcb"`.
- `"bcb"` is a palindrome. Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "yb"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Increment the first character three times: `"yb" -> "zb" -> "ab" -> "bb"`.
- `"bb"` is a palindrome. Thus, the answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
