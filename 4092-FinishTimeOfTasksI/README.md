[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/finish-time-of-tasks-i/)

---

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of tasks in a project, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. These tasks are connected as a **tree** rooted at task 0. This is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that task `u_i` is the parent of task `v_i`.

You are also given an array `baseTime` of length `n`, where `baseTime[i]` represents the time to complete task `i`.

The **finish time** of each task is calculated as follows:

- Leaf task: The finish time is `baseTime[i]`.
- Non-leaf task:

- Let `earliest` be the **minimum** finish time among its children, and `latest` be the **maximum** finish time among its children. - Let `ownDuration` be `(latest - earliest) + baseTime[i]`. - The finish time of task `i` is `latest + ownDuration`.

Return the finish time of the root task 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], baseTime = [9,5,3]

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:**

  
-    0 9  1 5  2 3  - Task 2 is a leaf, so its finish time is `baseTime[2] = 3`. - Task 1 has one child task 2:

 `earliest = latest = 3` - `ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[1] = 5` - Finish time of task 1 is `3 + 5 = 8`

- Task 0 has one child with finish time 8: - `earliest = latest = 8` - `ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = 9` - Finish time of task 0 is `8 + 9 = 17`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], baseTime = [4,7,6]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

  
-    0 4  1 7  2 6  - Task 1 is a leaf, so its finish time is `baseTime[1] = 7`. - Task 2 is a leaf, so its finish time is `baseTime[2] = 6`. - Task 0 has two children with finish times 7 and 6:

 `earliest = 6`, `latest = 7` - `ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = (7 - 6) + 4 = 5` - Finish time of task 0 is `latest + ownDuration = 7 + 5 = 12`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3]], baseTime = [5,8,2,1]

**Output:** 18

**Explanation:**

- Task 1 is a leaf, so its finish time is `baseTime[1] = 8`.
- Task 3 is a leaf, so its finish time is `baseTime[3] = 1`.
- Task 2 has one child task 3:

- `earliest = latest = 1` - `ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[2] = 0 + 2 = 2` - Finish time of task 2 is `latest + ownDuration = 1 + 2 = 3`

- Task 0 has two children with finish times 8 and 3: - `earliest = 3`, `latest = 8` - `ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = (8 - 3) + 5 = 10` - Finish time of task 0 is `latest + ownDuration = 8 + 10 = 18`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length = n - 1`
- `edges[i] == [u_i, v_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
- `u_i!= v_i`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
- `baseTime.length == n`
- `1 <= baseTime[i] <= 10^5`​​​​​​​
- The finish time of every task is guaranteed to be less than `2^53`.
