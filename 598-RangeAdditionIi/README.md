# 598. Range Addition II

**Difficulty:** Easy  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/)

---

You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of operations `ops`, where `ops[i] = [a_i, b_i]` means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all `0 <= x < a_i` and `0 <= y < b_i`.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4`
- `0 <= ops.length <= 10^4`
- `ops[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= a_i <= m`
- `1 <= b_i <= n`
