# 3980. Minimum Operations to Transform Binary String

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-transform-binary-string/)

---

You are given two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length `n`.

You can perform the following operations on `s1` any number of times, in any order:

- Choose an index `i` such that `s1[i] == '0'`, and change it to `'1'`.
- Choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1`, and both `s1[i]` and `s1[i + 1]` are `'1'`. Change both characters to `'0'`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2`. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "11", s2 = "00"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Change indices 0 and 1 from `'1'` to `'0'` in one operation, so `"11"` becomes `"00"`. Thus, the answer is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 = "01", s2 = "10"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Change index 0 from `'0'` to `'1'`, so `"01"` becomes `"11"`.
- Change indices 0 and 1 from `'1'` to `'0'`, so `"11"` becomes `"00"`.
- Change index 0 from `'0'` to `'1'`, so `"00"` becomes `"10"`.
- Thus, the answer is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 = "1", s2 = "0"

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

The first operation cannot change `'1'` to `'0'`, and the second operation requires two adjacent characters. Therefore, it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == s1.length == s2.length <= 10^5`
- `s1` and `s2` consist only of `'0'` and `'1'`.
