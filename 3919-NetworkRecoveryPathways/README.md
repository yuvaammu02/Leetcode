# 3620. Network Recovery Pathways

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-recovery-pathways/)

---

You are given a directed acyclic graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n &minus; 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `m`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, cost_i]` indicates a one‑way communication from node `u_i` to node `v_i` with a recovery cost of `cost_i`.

Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array `online` where `online[i] = true` means node `i` is online. Nodes 0 and `n &minus; 1` are always online.

A path from 0 to `n &minus; 1` is **valid** if:

- All intermediate nodes on the path are online.
- The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed `k`.

For each valid path, define its **score** as the minimum edge‑cost along that path.

Return the **maximum** path score (i.e., the largest **minimum**-edge cost) among all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,5],[1,3,10],[0,2,3],[2,3,4]], online = [true,true,true,true], k = 10

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- The graph has two possible routes from node 0 to node 3:

- Path `0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3`

  Total cost = `5 + 10 = 15`, which exceeds k (`15 > 10`), so this path is invalid.

- Path `0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3`

 - Total cost = `3 + 4 = 7 <= k`, so this path is valid.

 - The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(3, 4) = 3`.

- There are no other valid paths. Hence, the maximum among all valid path‐scores is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,7],[1,4,5],[0,2,6],[2,3,6],[3,4,2],[2,4,6]], online = [true,true,true,false,true], k = 12

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/06/06/graph-11.png)

- Node 3 is offline, so any path passing through 3 is invalid.

- Consider the remaining routes from 0 to 4:

- Path `0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 4`

  Total cost = `7 + 5 = 12 <= k`, so this path is valid.

 - The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(7, 5) = 5`.

- Path `0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4`

 - Node 3 is offline, so this path is invalid regardless of cost.

- Path `0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4`

 - Total cost = `6 + 6 = 12 <= k`, so this path is valid.

 - The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(6, 6) = 6`.

- Among the two valid paths, their scores are 5 and 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.

**Constraints:**

- `n == online.length`
- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= m == edges.length <=``min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, cost_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
- `u_i != v_i`
- `0 <= cost_i <= 10^9`
- `0 <= k <= 5 * 10^13`
- `online[i]` is either `true` or `false`, and both `online[0]` and `online[n &minus; 1]` are `true`.
- The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
