# 3999. Minimum Number of String Groups Through Transformations

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-string-groups-through-transformations/)

---

You are given an array of strings `words`.

Define a **transformation** on a string `s` as follows:

- Let `E` be the subsequence of characters at even indices of `s`.
- Let `O` be the **subsequence** of characters at odd indices of `s`.
- **Independently** cyclically shift `E` and `O` by **any** number of positions to the right, possibly zero.
- Reconstruct the string by placing the shifted `E` characters back into even indices and the shifted `O` characters back into odd indices.

Two strings are **equivalent** if one can be transformed into the other by a **single** transformation.

Partition `words` into the **minimum** number of groups such that:

- Every string belongs to **exactly** one group.
- Every pair of strings in the same group are **equivalent**.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of groups.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["ntgwz","zwntg"]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- For `"ntgwz"`, the even-index subsequence is `"ngz"` and the odd-index subsequence is `"tw"`.
- Shift `"ngz"` right by `1` position to obtain `"zng"`, and shift `"tw"` right by `1` position to obtain `"wt"`.
- After reconstructing the string, we obtain `"zwntg"`.
- Therefore, both strings are equivalent and belong to the same group.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["abc","cab","bac","acb","bca","cba"]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The strings can be partitioned into the following groups:

- `["abc","cba"]`
- `["cab","bac"]`
- `["acb","bca"]`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["leet","abb","bab","deed","edde","code","bba"]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The strings can be partitioned into the following groups:

- `["abb","bba"]`
- `["deed","edde"]`
- `["leet"]`
- `["bab"]`
- `["code"]`

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​All pairs of strings in each group are equivalent.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 5 * 10^5`
- The sum of `words[i].length` does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.
- `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
