# 461. Hamming Distance

**Difficulty:** Easy  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

---

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return *the **Hamming distance** between them*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       &uarr;   &uarr;
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= x, y <= 2^31 - 1`
