# 3989. Maximum Consistent Columns in a Grid

**Difficulty:** Hard  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-consistent-columns-in-a-grid/)

---

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, and an integer `limit`.

You may remove zero or more columns from the grid, but at least one column must remain. The **relative** order of the remaining columns must be preserved.

A grid is called **consistent** if for every row `i`, and for every pair of adjacent remaining columns `a` and `b` with `a < b`, the following holds: `|grid[i][b] - grid[i][a]| <= limit`.

Return the **maximum** number of columns that can remain such that the resulting grid is **consistent**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[-2,0,3]], limit = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- Remove column 2 and keep columns 0 and 1, which gives `|grid[0][1] &minus; grid[0][0]| = |0 &minus; (&minus;2)| = 2 <= limit`.
- Thus, the maximum number of columns that can remain is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,-1,1],[2,2,2]], limit = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- Remove column 1 and keep columns 0 and 2, which gives

- `|grid[0][2] &minus; grid[0][0]| = |1 &minus; 1| = 0 <= limit` and - `|grid[1][2] &minus; grid[1][0]| = |2 &minus; 2| = 0 <= limit`.

- Thus, the maximum number of columns that can remain is 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[-5,5]], limit = 9

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- Remove either column 0 or column 1, since `|grid[0][1] &minus; grid[0][0]| = |5 &minus; (&minus;5)| = 10 > limit`.
- Thus, the maximum number of columns that can remain is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m == grid.length <= 250`
- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 250`
- `-10^5 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= limit <= 10^5​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​`
